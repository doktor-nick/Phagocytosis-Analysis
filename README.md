# Phagocytosis Analysis Assay scripts

ImageJ macro scripts for the analysis of phagocytosis.

These scripts were initially created as part of the publication:
J. Yeo, A.Wall, J.L. Stow and N.A. Hamilton. High-throughput quantification of phagocytosis. Biotechniques 55(3):115-124.

Details on experimental set-up and the correct use of the macros can be found in the paper and its associated supplmentary material. Please reference this paper if you find the scripts useful.
